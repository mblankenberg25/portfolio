          <h2>The Day I Found Out I Was a Penn Stater!</h2>
          <p>I was accepted into Penn State Behrend at the start of my senior year. 
              It wasnâ€™t a clear cut decision when I got accepted. 
              I really got to know Coach Niland and the basketball team.  
              As I visited other colleges and met other coaches, 
              I knew Penn State Behrend was the school for me. 
              I am excited for what the future holds for me at Penn State Behrend.</p>
