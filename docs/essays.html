            <h1>Digit 100 Website Reflection</h1>
            <p>
                For Introduction to Digital Humanities, I was tasked on creating two websites
                containing the same content. Each website took patience and a lot of learning 
                on the go. One website was made on Penn State Sites or WordPress and the other
                was made on GitHub.  Even though each website expresses the same content, there
                are many differences between WordPress and GitHub.

                In my opinion, WordPress is easier to use to create a website. WordPress isn’t 
                very hard to navigate and it is pretty straight forward with all of the features.
                It has built-in themes, so you can choose one and start developing your website. 
                The most significant challenge I had with WordPress was creating different pages,
                such as my resume, gallery, or about me pages. Once I went through the tutorial of
                creating a page, developing on WordPress was a breeze. As you add more and more
                content to your pages, it is very easy to check the changes you made to the page.
                There is an update button on the right panel that allows you to see what the page
                will look like. Using the update button, I did some trial and error with the design
                and layout of my website. The best part about WordPress is that it doesn’t take any
                skill to create a website. I had no prior knowledge of website development and I was
                able to make a website. The only complaint I have about WordPress is that you have very
                limited freedom with the layout. I hate the confined space you have on each page to
                present your content. I wish there was an option for you to delete the side panels to
                allow all of your content to be expressed. It is also very difficult to type around
                images or attempt to use captions. Your words and images get all scrambled around when
                you try to do so. Other than the limited freedom, WordPress is a very user-friendly
                website developer.

                The other system I used to create a website was GitHub. I would say GitHub is the more
                difficult of the two systems to use, but I would rather use GitHub than WordPress. The 
                biggest difference between the two systems is that GitHub requires a lot of coding and 
                understanding of code. Coding a website is completely different from coding in Java or 
                C++, so it was a little different for me at first. Learning and copying code from other
                people allowed me to catch on quickly. If you struggle or don’t like to code, WordPress
                is probably the better option for making a website. My favorite part about GitHub is that
                it gives you the freedom to design your website whatever way you want it to look like. 
                There is a page that specifically is for the formatting and styling of your website, 
                called the CSS. I definitely would like to learn more about CSS and its features
                (using  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3Schools</a>). Specifically, I want to be able to style each
                individual image or section of code, using classes.  The only complaint I have is ‘pushing’
                your content into your website. After changing your code, you must use git commands 
                on GitBash. Then, it takes awhile for GitHub to process the code and configure your 
                new website. That can get annoying, especially if you do trial and error with the layout.
                Overall, WordPress is the system for beginners and GitHub is the system for more in depth
                website developing.
