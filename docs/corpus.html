            <h1>Biden vs Trump Inaugural Address</h1>
            <p>For this Corpus Analysis assignment, I chose to compare the inaugural addresses from 
                President Joesph Biden and former President Donald Trump. Using the tools AntConc 
                and Voyant, I am able to compare the frequencies of words or phrases of each speech. 
                I am also able to compare the speeches together. The references to N-grams mean the amount
                of words that are grouped together. </p>

            <p>
                In Biden's Address, it seems that he wants to advance America in the right 
                direction. The COVID-19 Pandemic was a in effect while he took office, so
                he urges Americans to push through this set back. You can see this when he 
                says 'we will press forward', 'we will need each other', and 'we will 
                get through this'.

            <p>In Trump's Address, it seems that he wants to restore what it is to be an American.
                He uses the repition of 'we will bring back' to show that he plans on getting the 
                country back to where it was flourishing.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                In Joseph Biden’s Inaugural Address, he describes how the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted America. 
                He goes on to illustrate how Americans will have to get through the tough times. In the Biden N-grams section,
                we can see that Biden repeatedly used the phrases ‘we will’ and ‘the people’. He uses these phrases to express
                pushing and getting through the pandemic. Some examples include, “We will need all our strength to persevere
                through this”, “we will get through this, together”, “we will press forward”, “we will write the next chapter”,
                “The will of the people has been heard”, and “we will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can”. 
                On the other hand, Donald Trump’s Inaugural Address didn’t take place during a pandemic. Trump describes how America
                needs to continue to advance the country. In the Trump N-grams section, we can see that Trump also frequently used 
                the phrases ‘we will’ and ‘the people’. He uses these phrases to show how America needs to take on the tough times,
                rather than just getting through them. Some examples include, “Today, January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day
                the people became the rulers of this nation”, “this government is controlled by the people”, “we will make America 
                strong again”, “we will make America safe again”, “we will confront hardships”, and “we will face challenges”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As I compared Biden’s and Trump’s Addresses to all of the past addresses, I found another key difference between 
                the two speeches. Most of the past addresses mention a reference to the Constitution, including Biden. Trump’s Address
                didn’t mention a reference to the Constitution once, but Biden’s Address referenced the Constitution three times.
                Although, Trump’s Address did use the phrase ‘of our country’ repeatedly, in which the past addresses had also used 
                that phrase frequently. Other than those few differences between the addresses from Biden and Trump, there wasn’t 
                much to compare. As the n-gram size increased over three, the two speeches didn’t have any similarities. As shown in 
                the Larger N-grams sections, the frequency of phrases were low and the range was most likely one, which meant it only 
                occurred in one of the speeches. Overall, Biden’s speech seemed to be all about getting through the pandemic and Trump’s 
                speech seemed to be about creating a better, more advanced country.
