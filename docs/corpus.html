        <h1>Biden vs Trump Inaugural Address</h1>
        
        <section> 
            <p>For this Corpus Analysis assignment, I chose to compare the inaugural addresses from 
                President Joesph Biden and former President Donald Trump. Using the tools AntConc 
                and Voyant, I am able to compare the frequencies of words or phrases of each speech. 
                I am also able to compare the speeches together. The references to N-grams mean the amount
                of words that are grouped together. </p>

            <p>
                In Biden's Address, it seems that he wants to advance America in the right 
                direction. The COVID-19 Pandemic was a in effect while he took office, so
                he urges Americans to push through this set back. You can see this when he 
                says 'we will press forward', 'we will need each other', and 'we will 
                get through this'.

            <p>In Trump's Address, it seems that he wants to restore what it is to be an American.
            He uses the repition of 'we will bring back' to show that he plans on getting the 
            country back to where it was flourishing.</p>
